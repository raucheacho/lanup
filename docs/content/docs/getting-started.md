# Getting Started

This guide will help you get up and running with lanup in just a few minutes.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and initialize lanup:

```bash
cd your-project
lanup init
```

This creates a `.lanup.yaml` configuration file in your project root.

## Step 2: Configure Your Services

Edit the `.lanup.yaml` file to define which services you want to expose:

```yaml
vars:
  SUPABASE_URL: "http://localhost:54321"
  API_URL: "http://localhost:8000"
  DASHBOARD_URL: "http://localhost:3000"

output: ".env.local"

auto_detect:
  docker: true
  supabase: true
```

### Configuration Options

- **vars**: Environment variables to expose (localhost URLs will be transformed)
- **output**: Path to the generated environment file (default: `.env.local`)
- **auto_detect**: Enable automatic detection of Docker containers and Supabase services

## Step 3: Start Your Services

Make sure your local services are running:

```bash
# Example: Start your backend
npm run dev

# Or start Docker containers
docker-compose up

# Or start Supabase
supabase start
```

## Step 4: Expose on Your Network

Run lanup to expose your services:

```bash
lanup start
```

You'll see output like:

```
✓ Successfully exposed services on your LAN!
✓ Environment file updated: .env.local
✓ Local IP: 192.168.1.100

=== Your services are now accessible at ===

  SUPABASE_URL: http://192.168.1.100:54321
  API_URL: http://192.168.1.100:8000
  DASHBOARD_URL: http://192.168.1.100:3000

ℹ Tip: Use 'lanup start --watch' to automatically update when your network changes
```

## Step 5: Access from Other Devices

Your services are now accessible from any device on the same network:

- **Mobile phone**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://192.168.1.100:3000`
- **Tablet**: Use the exposed URLs in your app configuration
- **Another computer**: Access the services using the network IP

## Using Watch Mode

To automatically update when your network changes (e.g., switching from Wi-Fi to Ethernet):

```bash
lanup start --watch
```

lanup will monitor your network and update the environment file whenever your IP address changes.

## Generated Environment File

lanup creates a `.env.local` file with your transformed URLs:

```bash
# Generated by lanup on 2025-10-27 23:50:12
# Do not edit the managed variables manually

# lanup:managed
SUPABASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:54321
# lanup:managed
API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8000
# lanup:managed
DASHBOARD_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000

# User variables (preserved)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
SECRET_KEY=my-secret
```

Variables marked with `# lanup:managed` are updated by lanup. Other variables are preserved.
